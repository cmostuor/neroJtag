NeroJTAG is yet another protocol for a USB JTAG adaptor. Currently there is a patch for Zolt√°n
Csizmadia's xilprg to support the protocol, and a firmware for USB AVRs based on Dean Camera's
LUFA. Firmware for the Cypress FX2LP to follow...

The project build assumes a directory structure like this:

src
|
+-apps
| |
| +-nanduinoJtag
|
+-libs
|
+-3rd

*** BUILDING ON LINUX ***

make -f Makefile.linux


The build will fetch, patch and build xilprg with NeroJTAG support. You can then do (for example):

   xilprg/nero.sh 1 s3demo.bit

The AVR firmware currently targets the AT90USB162. Change the Makefile if you have a different
MCU. Suitable hardware platforms include the Nanduino, Teensy, Benito etc etc.
